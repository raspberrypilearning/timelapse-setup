## What you will make

[[[camera-bullseye]]]

In this resource you'll write a small script to capture multiple images, using a Pi camera over a long period of time. These images can then be combined into an animated GIF, allowing you to view very slow events in a few seconds, using the power of time-lapse photography.

## What you will learn
By following the Timelapse project, you will learn:

- How to capture still images with the Pi camera
- How to use a `for` loop to capture multiple images with different file names
- How to use command line programs within a Python script
- How to use ImageMagick to create animated GIFs

 

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)
- [Use basic digital, analogue, and electromechanical components](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/creator)
