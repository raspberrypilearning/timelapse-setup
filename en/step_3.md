## Time-lapse animations with a Raspberry Pi

Time-lapse photography uses multiple images taken over a long period of time, which are then stitched together to produce an animated sequence of images.

If you've never seen a time-lapse before, then the one below is an example of what can be achieved.

If you've never used the Raspberry Pi Camera Module before, then it's probably a good idea to have a quick look through the first few steps in the [Getting started with PiCamera](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-picamera/worksheet/) resource to familiarise yourself with the device, and to make sure it's working properly.
